# POSTMORTEM

## Project Overview

This D&D character builder app was developed as the final project for a coding bootcamp. The app aimed to simplify the complex process of creating a Dungeons & Dragons character by guiding users through character creation, automating calculations, and generating character sheets.

### Key Features

- Parsing and presenting character options from 35 rulebooks
- Step-by-step character creation process with contextual rule and lore information
- Automated stat calculations and ability derivations
- Character saving, editing, and loading functionality
- Generation of playable character sheets

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Vite, MantineUI
- Backend: MongoDB, ExpressJS
- State Management: Redux
- Routing: Remix
- PDF Generation: PDFLib

## Development Process

### Timeline
The project was completed in an intensive 3-week period.

### Team Structure
Unlike the typical 3-person teams in the bootcamp, this project was undertaken solo to maximize learning opportunities and personal growth.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Management
Working with an extensive dataset from 35 rulebooks posed significant challenges. The data often included features from technologies not used in this project, requiring careful parsing and stripping of unnecessary information.

### Technology Integration
Some technologies that initially seemed ideal for the project proved less flexible than anticipated. Tough decisions were made to remove certain tools that were hindering progress rather than facilitating it.

### Time Constraints
The project's ambitious scope and the 3-week timeline necessitated strict prioritization. Features like a character gold shop and progression beyond level one had to be shelved.

## Successes and Achievements

### Creative Problem-Solving
Innovative solutions were developed to handle complex data structures and organization. These solutions often pushed the boundaries of the developer's capabilities, resulting in code that was both effective and creatively implemented.

### Solo Development
Successfully completing such a complex project individually, in a program designed for team projects, demonstrated strong self-motivation and adaptability.

### Feature Completeness
Despite time constraints, the app achieved its core functionality, providing a comprehensive character creation experience from start to character sheet generation.

## Lessons Learned

### Data Structure and Integration
Insight: Incorporating data more gradually and restructuring it based on application needs could have improved efficiency.
Lesson: Begin with a smaller dataset and expand, allowing for more flexible data structuring as the application evolves.

### Time Management and Prioritization
Insight: The project reinforced the importance of prioritizing completion over perfection.
Lesson: Focus on delivering a functional product first, then iterate and improve if time allows.

### Technology Selection
Insight: Some chosen technologies proved less suitable than initially thought.
Lesson: Conduct more thorough evaluations of technologies before committing to them in a time-sensitive project.

## Future Considerations

While there are no plans for further development, potential areas for expansion include:
- Implementing a character gold shop
- Enabling character progression beyond level one
- Optimizing data parsing and organization for improved performance

## Conclusion

This D&D character builder app project was a significant undertaking that pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved in a short timeframe. It provided invaluable experience in full-stack development, data management, and project prioritization. The challenges faced and overcome during this project have contributed to substantial growth as a developer, reinforcing the importance of adaptability, creative problem-solving, and the ability to deliver under pressure.
